# Case Management System

## Project Overview
A Python-based case management system built with Pydantic for robust data validation and serialization. The system tracks cases, their states, priorities, assignments, and maintains a complete history of all actions.

## Core Components

### Models
- **Case**: Main case model with all functionality
- **Priority**: Enum (low, medium, high, very_high)
- **CaseState**: Enum (new, in_progress, awaiting_customer_info, resolved)
- **Component**: System component with ID and description
- **Assignee**: Person who can be assigned to cases
- **Comment**: Conversation entries with author info
- **ActionTimestamp**: Detailed tracking of all actions

### Key Features
- ✅ Priority levels (low, medium, high, very high)
- ✅ Case states (new, in_progress, awaiting_customer_info, resolved)
- ✅ Component association
- ✅ Optional assignee
- ✅ Conversation/comments system
- ✅ Action timestamps
- ✅ JSON serialization

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New Case
```python
from models import Case, Priority

case = Case.create_new(
    title="Login page not loading",
    priority=Priority.HIGH,
    creator_name="Support Agent"
)
```

### Adding Comments
```python
case.add_comment(
    content="Working on this now",
    author_id=user_id,
    author_name="John Doe",
    is_internal=True
)
```

### Changing State
```python
case.change_state(
    new_state=CaseState.IN_PROGRESS,
    performed_by_name="John Doe"
)
```

## Dependencies
